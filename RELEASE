v25

## Changes

* When using a Nix version newer than 2.13, `nix-quick-install-action` will now automatically add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` and `accept-flake-config = true` to the Nix configuration. This means that if you are using flakes you don't have to add these settings yourself to the `nix_conf` action input.

* If you have a `nixConfig` attribute in your `flake.nix`, `nix-quick-install-action` will now automatically load it into the installed Nix configuration. This means that even old-style Nix commands (like `nix-build`, `nix-store` etc) will be able to use the Nix configuration from `flake.nix`. This feature was contributed by @blaggacao.
