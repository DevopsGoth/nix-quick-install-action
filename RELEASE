v21

## Changes

* `nix-quick-install-action` now supports installation into a pre-existing `/nix` directory. This means that you for example can cache the contents of `/nix` between different jobs or different runs of one job, for performance gains. `nix-quick-install-action` will not remove any existing content found in the Nix database or store. For this to work, the pre-existing `/nix` directory must be writeable by the job runner user.
